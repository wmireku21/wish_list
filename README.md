# Purpose
The purpose of the this project was to practice making a full-stack product using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and incorporate Redux as well. This was the first project that really gave me experience using these technologies, especially Redux. I also learned how to set up REST API to communicate data from and to the database from the UI.
